# Kamunity Platform - Launch Plan & Strategy

**Launch Date: August 21st, 2025**

## Platform Vision

Kamunity is a digital platform for collective impact that supports the natural progression from informal chat-based idea generation to structured, action-oriented communities. The platform follows a hierarchical organization model: **Chat â†’ Focus Rooms â†’ Clubs â†’ Communities**, with AI-powered summary tools and cooperative federation models.

**Core Philosophy:** "Community begins with one spark" - scaling individual passion into collective impact through democratic, cooperative governance.

## Development Strategy: Community-Driven Build

### Phase 2: Community Seeding & Testing
- Mixed content sources: Kamunity team + partner organizations (NGOs, support groups, book clubs, hiking sites)
- Clear attribution and shared value exchange for all sourced content
- Community testing of governance models through actual use
- Manual curation evolving through community dialectic and living labs

### Phase 3: Progressive AI Integration
